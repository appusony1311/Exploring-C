A binary tree is a special type of tree in which every node or vertex has either 
no child node or one child node or two child nodes. 

A binary tree is an important class of a tree data structure in which a node can have at most two children.

A Binary Tree node contains following parts.


   -> Data
   -> Pointer to left child
   -> Pointer to right child


Depth First Traversals:
(a) Inorder (Left, Root, Right) : 4 2 5 1 3
(b) Preorder (Root, Left, Right) : 1 2 4 5 3
(c) Postorder (Left, Right, Root) : 4 5 2 3 1

Breadth First or Level Order Traversal : 1 2 3 4 5


Level (of a node): The number of parent nodes corresponding to a given a node of the tree. 

For example, the root, having no parent, is at level 0
