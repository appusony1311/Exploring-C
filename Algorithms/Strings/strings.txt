Reverse words in a given String







Check if a string is substring of another
check if a given string is shuffled substring of another string
find the longest subtsring with k unique characters in a given string
longest substring with atmost k distinct characters
find longest substring with repetition of characters - to come back
length of longest valid substring
length of the longest substring without repeating characters
number of substrings- containing all three characters - to come back
replace the substring for balanced string
max consecutive ones -iii - to come back
get equal substrings within budget - to come back


longest common substring - to come back & check - may be importat

sliding window maximum - to be checked in arrays very importat


check for subsequence
check if a string is a subsequence of another
shortest common supersequence
